        "The above code generates the next word predictions based on a given seed text. The ‘seed_text’ variable holds the initial text. The ‘next_words’ variable determines the number of predictions to be generated. Inside the for loop, the ‘seed_text’ is converted into a sequence of tokens using the tokenizer. The token sequence is padded to match the maximum sequence length.\n",

        "The model predicts the next word by calling the ‘predict’ method on the model with the padded token sequence. The predicted word is obtained by finding the word with the highest probability score using ‘np.argmax’. Then, the predicted word is appended to the ‘seed_text’, and the process is repeated for the desired number of ‘next_words’. Finally, the ‘seed_text’ is printed, which contains the initial text followed by the generated predictions.\n",
